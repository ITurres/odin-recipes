odin recipes (website test)
The following project is about to get a close look and feel of the new commands learned.
I practiced more and empowered the use of absolute links, I had the same problem few times when all my text was underlined as a link, and finally i understood to end the paragrapht with the close anchor (</a>)
I also got better using the Ordered and Unordered lists commands, since i had loads to write down.
My command line skills has improved!.
