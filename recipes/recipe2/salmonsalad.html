        <h3>Here’s a fun way to mix up lunch with a spin on a deli-style favorite: Salmon Salad! It’s a creamy, crunchy mix of tangy flavors: just like <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/classic-tuna-salad/">  Tuna Salad </a>
            but using canned salmon.
            Or, use it as a smart way to revitalize <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/leftover-salmon-recipes/">leftover salmon! </a> The flavor is savory and satisfying, and this recipe has a healthy spin with less mayo. You can also class it up for a fancy brunch and serve it with fresh herbs on a croissant.
            It takes just 5 minutes, and works with crackers, in lettuce wraps, in a sandwich, and more. Lunch just got tastier!</h3>
